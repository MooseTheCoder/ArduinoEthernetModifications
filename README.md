# What is this place for?

I have been playing about with an arduino ethernet shield, powered by a w5100, I was having a problem with some data being cut off. 

After some digging around in the code, I managed to change the number of max connections and therefore allow me to increase the max buffer size.

This repo are the modifications I made, useless to anybody apart from me of course :D
